\subsection{Well posed problems and Simple PDEs}

An important question with PDEs is what additional data are needed to give a unique solution?

Hadamard called a problem (PDE + data) well posed if:

\begin{enumerate}

\item It has a solution
\item The solution is unique
\item The solution depends continuously on the initial data.

\end{enumerate}
